## wap in 5 minutes

These instructions create and upload a working addon without editing a single line of code!

1. Download and install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install `wap`:

    ```console
    pip install --upgrade --user wow-addon-packager
    ```

3. Create a new a project:

    ```console
    wap new-project
    ```

    And then, answer the prompts. Don't worry too much about your answers -- you can always change
    them later in your configuration file.

4. Change to your new project's directory. For example, if you named it `MyAddon` in the last step,
   you'd type:

    ```console
    cd MyAddon
    ```

5. Build your addon package and link it to your local World of Warcraft installation:

    ```console
    wap build --link
    ```

    At this point, **you can play the game with your addon**.

6. Upload your addon to CurseForge with your
   [API token](https://authors.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens) so that others can use it:

    ```console
    wap upload --curseforge-token "<api-token>"
    ```
