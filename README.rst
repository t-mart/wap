``wap`` in 5 minutes
--------------------

.. five-minutes-begin

This entire set of instructions is runnable without editing a single line of code!

1. `Download Python 3.9 or greater`_ and install it.

2. Install ``wap`` with pip:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pip install --upgrade --user wow-addon-packager

3. Create a new project:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ wap quickstart MyAddon  # or whatever name you'd like!

   and answer the prompted questions. Don't worry too much about your answers -- you can
   always change them later in your configuration file.

   Then change to your new project's directory

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd "MyAddon"

4. Package your addon

   .. code-block:: console

      $ wap package

5. Install your addon so you can test it out in your local WoW installation:

   Windows
      .. code-block:: console

         $ wap dev-install --wow-addons-path "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns"

   macOS
      .. code-block:: console

         $ wap dev-install --wow-addons-path "/Applications/World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns"

   .. note::

      Also check out the ``watch`` command for automatic repackage and re-dev-installation!

6. Upload your project to CurseForge

   .. code-block:: console

      $ wap upload --addon-version "dev" --curseforge-token "<your-token>"

   You can generate a new token at Curseforge's `My API Tokens`_ page.
